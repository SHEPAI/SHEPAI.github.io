      <h4><b>SHEP</b></h4>
      <h6><i>A computer would only deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human into believing that it was human. - Alan Turing</i></h6>
      <p>The system is able to read a main file and create files and create pathway links depending on what is in the input. <br />The system is able to expand its knowledge through a series of text files with links to eachother. 

The system has speech to text for its main input.<br /> By using serial communication, the AI can receive and send data to an Arduino, this Arduino has servos which can read <br />its own position so the user can record actions and play them on command. The data from the servos will store on a local SD card.
<br />
The AI has audio output text to speech on top to make it a full audio I/O system. The system has a graphical interface which allows you to interact.
<br />
The system has a data file organized alphabetically with every word in the English language, the user has added, and what they categorize as. 
<br />
This system runs on raspberry pi and desktop although SHEP is programmed into the Pi. 

<br /><br />Lots of people ask; "why is SHEP called SHEP?". SHEP is named SHEP as its developer was Dexter Shepherd 
<br />and his name could be shortned down. Dexter named his AI after himself because it builds trust in an AI when it has a human connection.
<br />Dexter Shepherd feels that SHEP being named after him shows more passion and commitment to SHEP and the project.
<br /><br />SHEP has been under development since 2014 and the theory of SHEP developed since 2013. 
<br />SHEP's first verson was on C++ written by Dexter Shepherd. SHEP didnt work as the theory was still under development
<br />but SHEP continued as a project. 
<br />It was only until 2015 SHEP became a learning algorithm and started to develop rapidly from a text = data analyser all the way to a network of files linking using a database on the English language.
<br /><br />SHEP is currently being developed so it can not only learn from the user, but learn from watching people communicate and saving these respnonses in its data. 
<br />This is a bit like how a human learns.
<br />
<img src="assets/prod.jpg" alt="SHEP GUI	" style="width:304px;height:200px;">
<br />Above shows SHEP on a touchscreen TFT. This is SHEP's head, the USB ports on the side are used to connect to an external sound card, a wireless internet dongle and an Arduino for serial output (actions)
<br /><br />We want SHEP's data files to expand in knowledge and social responses so SHEP can appear to be human and appear to be understanding.
SHEP is being developed further so it can reply based on the topic of conversation instead of just reading and writing what is in its data. 
We want SHEP to further be able to apply logic to input and output by recording lgic in its data. This means SHEP could apply knowledge to different situations.
<br />The SHEP AI projects is only being developed by one programmer at its current stage, This means that programming is taking longer than it could.
<br />SHEPY is a 'dumbed down' version of SHEP. It does not have the same understanding of language as SHEP does but it simply learns through conversation. It is a
		  test for algorithms, and simple to modify using its source code provided.

<br /><br />Demo SHEP does not have audio capibilities however it uses text.
<br /><br />This SHEP Code is Copyright by Dexter Shepherd on the 18/02/2017 as SHEP AI©
<br /><br />The voice input demo will require a USB speech to text device. Any device which sends through a string of text and enter button will work. SHEP
is being developed to have USB inputs which work specifically using cameras and voice recognition.
<br />SHEP has a menu which allows you to read infomation and add to its English language database. SHEP sorts 
data out into a trigger word, subject word and comand word. 
<br />In the sentence "how are you feeling", we see "how" as the triger to trigger a question, "feeling" as the subject and
"you" is the command. "how" tells the computer what kind of sentence it is, this case being a question. "feeling" tells the computer what you are
 talking about, in this case being feelings. "you" tells the computer you are asking it how it is feeling, within the "feeling" folder it will have "you" and the
		   learned response.
<br />"How you" on its own tells anyone it is a question about the person receiving. This could be regarding anything 
such as "how do you sing", "sing" would be the command to differ from "are". 
<br /><br />More examples are "who is Winston Churchill":
<br />"who" = question
<br />"Churchill" = subject
<br />"is" = command
<br /><br />There will be a file called Churchill which gathers data about him. Command words will 
create infomation keypoints in SHEP's brain. "is" "born" "job".
