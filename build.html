		<hr class="break">
		<p>
			In this tutorial we will make our own portable SHEP AI. You can modify the code to work best for your own robotic system.
			
			This tutorial will go over the hardware needed, the setting up of libraries and configuring of the Raspberry Pi to make 
			SHEP portable. It is up to you how you want it to look and what interface you use.
			
			</p><h2 class="headerText">Picking parts</h2><p>
			Firstly we will want to pick our hardware. How do we want the AI to look and interact? I have personally used the Pimoroni 
			Unicorn HAT 16x16. I have used th I2S Adafruit Microphone which uses pin 18 on the Pi's GPIO. You will need to consider what pins are being used. 
			If you decided to use the Unicorn HAT 8x8 which also used pin 18, you may want to consider using a USB microphone. 
			<br>
			I will be using the Raspberry Pi 3 model A+, as it has a USB where I can insert a WiFi dongel, and it has an Audio jack which saves me 
			needing to purchase an audio HAT or module. I will get a PCB prototyping hat to attach the microphone. 
			<img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;" src="">
			
			</p><h2 class="headerText">Wiring it up</h2><p>
			The HAT for the Pi fits nicely on, but our I2S requires wiring. Firstly we will older on the I2S microphone onto the PCB. 
			Solder it near one of the sides so your voice will reach it. The Pins connect up as follows:
			
			<ul>
				<li>3V to 3.3V</li>
				<li>GND to GND</li>
				<li>BCLK to BCM 18</li>
				<li>DOUT to BCM20</li>
				<li>LRCL to BDM19</li>
			</ul>
			<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2s-mems-microphone-breakout/raspberry-pi-wiring-test">Here is a more in depth tutorial for the I2S Mic</a>
			On top of the Pi you will place the PCB, then on top of that place the Unicorn HAT.
			I attached a switch to a 4xAA battery pack so that SHEP could be mobile. 
			
			</p><h2 class="headerText">Installing software</h2><p>
			Once you have picked your hardware you will need to install the libraries. For me that will be the Unicorn Hat 16x16 library. 
			I will boot up my pi, connect it to the internet and open up the terminal (CTRL ALT T).
			<br>
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo pip3 install unicornhathd
			</div>
			Then we will will need to configure the rest of our hardware. If you are using your own microphone method the you will need to install 
			that your way. For us we will be using the I2S microphone. 
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">cd ~
			<br>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/
			Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/master/i2smic.sh
			<br>chmod +x i2smic.sh
			<br>sudo ./i2smic.sh
			</div>
			After this you will follow the prompts. We are using the Pi 3 so will select model option 2. We will then 
			select Y for auto boot as we will want it to load in every time we turn the AI on. After this simply reboot.
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo reboot
			</div>
			We will then want to make sure that the code is using the audio jack for output (unless you have your own means). 
			This can be done through sudo raspi-config > advanced options > audio >audio jack. 
			This should configure all the audio options that you need. 
			<br>
			Next we will actually install SHEP. 
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo wget https://shepai.github.io/code/run.zip
			</div>
			Extract the file which you have downloaded into a folder path of your choosing. Remember the exact pathway as you will be 
			using it later.
			<br>
			You will need to download all the libraries and software needed:
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo pip3 install wavio
			<br>sudo pip3 install sounddevice
			<br>sudo pip3 install soundfile
			<br>sudo pip3 install wave
			<br>sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
			<br>sudo pip3 install speechrecognition
			<br>sudo pip3 install nltk
			<br>sudo apt-get install espeak
			<br>sudo python3
			<br>>>>import nltk
			<br>nltk.download()
			</div>
			Follow the prompts on the nltk and click download. This may take a while.
			What we are doing here is installing all the data needed for SHEP to understand language.
			<br>
			NOTE:
			<br>If you have errors later on with espeak then you will need to install nltk like so:
			<div width="80%" lass="codeBox">python3
			<br>>>>import nltk
			<br>nltk.download()
			</div>
			<br>
			</p><h2 class="headerText">Configuring the Pi</h2><p>
			
			We will want out Python script to load every time we turn the Pi on. 
			This will be done using the following:
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo nano /etc/profile
			</div>
			At the bottom of this file we will add 
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo python3 /pathway_to_folder/HyperCube.py &
			</div>
			The pathway will be wherever you saved it. If you are having trouble with espeak then you may need to do the following:
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo adduser pi root
			
			</div>
			Then in /etc/profile add the same code but without sudo.
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">python3 /pathway_to_folder/HyperCube.py &
			</div>
			This will then boot your python code automatically. Before we reboot we have one more thing to add.
			We will not need to use the GUI so can go to:
			<div width="80%" class="codeBox">sudo raspi-config
			</div>
			and change the boot option to boot to console autologin.
			<img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;"
  width="80%" src="assets/boot.png">
			
			</p><h2 class="headerText">Altering the code for your own hardware</h2><p>
			Being you set your microphone up as the default Raspberry Pi Mic, the audio should
			work fine. If you have used other means for audio output rather than the inbuild audio jack 
			then once again, make sure it is the default.
			<br>
			I have added in a green dot into the corner of the eye to signify when the audio is listening. 
			This makes it easier to interact with. Something you may want to consider doing in your own interface. 
			<br><br>
			To alter the eye code for your own blink algorithm you will need to edit 3 different functions.
			<br>recordLED(type)
			<br>displayEye()
			<br>blink()<br>
			These are the ones which need editing. The recordLED turns an LED on or off 
			depending if the system is recording. The other two are the ones which read in a text file and display the colours on the map.
			You can set this in any way you wish, and import new libraries for your own interface. 
			<br><br>
			Below shows a tutorial on youtube of how to set up the voice recognition AI. You can follow this if you wish to start the code from 
			scratch and add your own sensors and outputs.
