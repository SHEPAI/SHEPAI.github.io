      <h4><b>Getting started</b></h4>
      
      <p>Get your SHEP and plug in an HDMI
cable, connecting it to a monitor or
screen. Then plug your keyboard
into SHEP’s USB ports. After this you
may power it on. You will see a black
screen, wait for it to load and you
will be given Wi-Fi options. Simply
enter the number of your network
and it’s password. </p>
		<img src="assets/wifi.png" alt="AI" class="w3-image" style="display:block;margin:auto" width="500" height="533">
      <p>After this it will ask you to fill out
information about you. This is so
SHEP knows you.
After set up, you no longer need to
use the keyboard or HDMI – unless
you change your Wi-Fi.</p>
		<h4><b>Using SHEP</b></h4>
      <p>The LEDs will flash about to show
SHEP is thinking. When the LEDs
stop flashing and hold still, SHEP is
listening to what you say. Always
start your sentence with “robot”.
“Robot what is your name”
“Robot how are you feeling”
SHEP will ignore you if you either
don’t say “robot”, or speak when
the LEDs are not holding steady</p>
		<p>When SHEP does not understand,
the AI will prompt you saying why it
does not understand. SHEP uses 3
keywords or key-phrases to
understand. A trigger word which
defines what type of sentence it is.
“Who” “What” “how” would all
signify questions. Subject words are
the key point of the sentence such
as “Winston Churchill” in the
question “who is Winston Churchill”.</p>
		<p>The final word is a word which
identifies the information for the
subject. “who is Alan Turing” where
“is” is the command. “how old is
Alan Turing” where “old” is the
command. In the data it would learn
who he is, his age and any other key
information. Along the way SHEP
learns words with similar meaning
without the user needing to teach
them.</p>
		<p>If all the words are added, but SHEP
does not have them in it’s memory,
SHEP will use the Internet to find an
answer. SHEP will either find one, or
ask you how to respond. This is
where you can teach SHEP. SHEP
saves all answers in it’s data – so if
you are unhappy with the saved
reply, you can change it.</p>
		<h4><b>Editing</b></h4>
		<p>To edit SHEP’s data you can say
“robot edit”
SHEP will ask you which sentence
and what to replace it with. You do
not have to say “robot” at the
			beginning of these.</p>
		<h4><b>Actions</b></h4>
		<p>If you want SHEP to do more than
learn how to reply, when adding or
editing a sentence SHEP. SHEP will
ask how should it respond, and you
can say “action” or “an action”. You
can then say what the file is called
and SHEP will add it. The files are
python files, and can be added
through a USB.</p>
		<p>On your USB flash drive, create a
folder called “AI” then inside that
create another folder called
“actions”. This must be directly
accessible “Devicename/AI/actions”
To transfer data, put your actions in
the actions folder, plug your USB
device into SHEP and say “robot add
action”. SHEP will automatically read
and transfer your files.</p>
