		<th>Project</th>
		<th>Requirements</th>
		<tr>
		<th>Image system</th>
		<th>To be able to make out objects and remember them by assigning to a symbol/code. We have been using the PixiCam and barcodes on objects to help with this. The information 
		around each of the objects should record the object code and what is it doing? Moving up, away, down, left, right, towards? The system will need to return the image code and a short recognizable description. If this 
		can be done with a normal camera/image sensor wired to the Arduino, it would cut costs and be better.<br></th>
		<tr>
		<th>Audio system</th>
		<th>Using a microphone to read raw sound, for example "43,42,45,43,65,43". The data will need to be split up into what is said. "quiet-talking-quiet". Data will need to be organized to quickly be found in simularity with data stored in memory 
		from other previous inputs. It must use symbols/codes to represent what is said, and returning that.<br></th>
		<tr>
		<th>SHEP network</th>
		<th>SHEP can read device requests, and help cache information to speed up the network. The Python library will help<br></th>
		<tr>
		<th>SHEP manufacturing arm</th>
		<th>Speed up manufacturing by creating a robotic Biped Arm which learns what to do. The servos ill need to be strong enough to 
		actually work in a system, and take in inputs to know what parts to look for and how to use it.<br></th>
		<tr>
		<th>Robot chassis</th>
		<th>Chassis are always great to have with SHEP. They need to have basic "instincts" programmed in to walk and move. They need ultrasonic range finder mount points, and 
		PixiCam mount points. 3D printable is what we mostly work with as it is exchangable over the internet.<br></th>
