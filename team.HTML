      <h4><b>The Team</b></h4>
      <h6><i>The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation - Leo Cherne</i></h6>
      <p>SHEPs code may have been developed by one person, Dexter Shepherd, but these skills were learned in a team at PACA (Portslade Aldridge Community Academy).
	  <br />The team was created around 2015 when a Sussex university student, Antony, came into teach us code. The higher students who were the top of
	  the class were chosen to join into a project. This project was the starburst eliments.
	  <br /><br />The starburst elements project is an interactive learning game with many subject 
	  <br />applications. The project is a game you can add questions and answers to, by scanning 
	  <br />in objects with RFID tags to be picked up on the RFID scanner; the game saves it and 
	  <br />retrieves it when the user plays it. LEDs flash on the board next to the picture it was 
	  <br />assigned to,  We used the periodic table as an example so it flashed an element up,  
	  <br />but it could be used for many other things such as countries and flags, car and engine 
	  <br />parts ect... 
	  <br /><br />This team went to numerous competitions and won national awards such as the 2015 STEMNET award at the houses of parliment
	  <br />This led on to be a trip to CERN. Morgan Pile and Dexter Shepherd were chosen to represent the group.
	  <br /><br />After these projects, the team wanted a new project. Dexter Shepherd had always has a fasination with AI and wanted to create it.
	  <br />Some of his peers told him that he could never do and discouraged him. Dexter did not listen and went on to developed
	  <br />SHEP. The team was interested when he posted it in a FB group chat, they decided for this to be their newest project.
	  <br />The team then decided on roles for each person based on their abilities. 
	  <br />
	  <h1>The team</h1>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="dexter">Dexter Shepherd - Programmer</a></h2>
      <p>Dexter Shepherd is the joint leader and primary software developer. Dexter developed the theory of the AI and the programmed it onto the Arduino Mega. This also led him to create the Raspberry Pi AI on Python.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="guolin">Guolin Yang - Programmer</a></h2>
      <p>Guolin Yang is the other leader of the group. He is a software developer. He has devloped the C++ iteration of the AI, this was using Dexter's arduino code for translate. The c++ AI was used as a prototype.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="morgan">Morgan Pile - Designer</a></h2>
      <p>Morgan Pile is the designer of the group. Morgan does not only design logos and graphical interfaces but design parts to be 3d printed for the hardware of the AI.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="josh">Josh Hassett - Hardware Developer</a></h2>
      <p>Josh is the hardware assembler of the team, he puts together the parts that Morgan designs. He has also refine some of the 3D printed objects to smoothen them out and make sure they are safer for handling. Josh also helps to keep the team moral up.</p>
