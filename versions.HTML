      <h4><b>Versions</b></h4>
      <h6><i>The best way to stay consistent is to change with the circumstances - Winston Churchill</i></h6>
      <p><strong>Type one:</strong>
		  <br />  <strong>-V1.0</strong> = This was the learning algorithm code using text input on the Arduino Uno
	  <br />  <strong>-V1.1</strong> = This was the updated version with audio input and output. This version also possesed artificial emotions.
	  <br />  <strong>-V1.2</strong> = This version had servo output and an updated voice input. This version also possesed a touchscreen interface
	  <br />These versions had their problems such as; audio not working, not enough RAM, wiring errors. These bugs were fixed but it was decided SHEP needs to be updates.
	  <br /><br /><strong>Type two:</strong>
	  <br />  <strong>-AI_2</strong> = This algorithm spread across multiple boards, the user could decide on their own input and wire i2c channels to the main AI board.
	  <br />This version was bulky and had alot of wires coming out consistently.
	  <br /><br /><strong>Type three:</strong>
	  <br />  <strong>-V0.0.1</strong> = This version used a desktop computer on Python, it had better audio i/o capibilities and the ability to output through servos. this version creates a nueral network of files.
	  <br />  <strong>-V0.0.2</strong> = This version is on the Raspberry Pi and has an interactive GUI, an understanding of the english language, the ability to output through servos and text input if there is no internet connection.
	  <br /><br />Below shows downloads to older versions and how to make them. These are not very advanced AIs, more of theory testers. 
	  <br />  <strong>-V0.0.3</strong> = This moved to a nicer UI. The AI could respond based on the topic of conversation, and split long sentences up into smaller ones. Volitile 
		  subjects were introduced, and new layers of vocabulary. 
		  <br />  <strong>-V0.0.4</strong> = The ability to play actions was introduced. Voice recognition was taken away, and text input re-introduced. A text to speech USB input was developed.
		  <br />  <strong>-V0.0.5</strong> = This version was to scrap a GUI, and run using voice input and output only. 
		  <br/></br/><strong>Type four</strong>
	   <br />  <strong>-V0.0.6</strong> = This version pushed the AI into the world of object oriented code. This opened up its abilities, and made it easier to
	  code and adapt to solve problems. It also introduced automatic subject adding
	   <br />  <strong>-V0.1.1</strong> = This version is the SHEP AI library for V0.0.6
	   <br />  <strong>-V0.0.7</strong> = This version got rid of any sort of manual vocabulary adding, and automatically read and saved words. Multiple keywords can be
	  added to a phrase being saved, to increase accuracy. An internet search is done to answer the user's questions, and links saved so the AI can quickly answer them again.

<br />SHEP is continuing through development. Up to Version 0.0.6, all the SHEP code was written in a procedural method. Now SHEP is 
		object oriented, which means ease of control and easier to adapt into different products.
